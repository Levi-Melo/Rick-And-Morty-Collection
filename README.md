A Website where you can save all your favorites characters from "Rick And Morty" TV Show 
</div>

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Proposal

### You should create a single-page Typescript React application where we can:

- Search a character by name;
- View loading feedback while API is not responding;
- Exibir mensagem de erro caso o personagem n√£o exista;
- Display minimum information about the characters if they exists;
- Register the character in the favorites list using some global state control library or the native React Context API;
- View list of favorite characters;
- Delete character from list;
